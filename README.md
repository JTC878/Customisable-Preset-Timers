Customisable Preset Timers 


Project Vision:

I am planning to make a single-page application which will allow you to add multiple customised timers to different times at different days of the week. These timers will be customised by the user from a preset option, and I'm intending to implement both popular timer presets such as stopwatches, normal timers and alarms but also unique, niche and exotic timer presets which I will find in my research. In this way, I believe it will make my project stand out from other timer applications - to be able to add niche timers that can be set to specific times alongside other popular timers and the ability to customise each one extensively. 

Having said that one of the most important aspects of this application is the customisation functionality of each timer preset, some examples of specific customisation options could include start time, end time or duration, alarm sound, alarm volume, browser notification options etc… Of course each timer preset will have a different set of configuration options depending on what type of timer it is. I also intend to allow the user to export/import their configuration settings so they don’t have to redo everything every time they open the application. I have also considered the consequence of an application like this needing to be open for long periods of time, most probably in the background of their device, to be useful to the user. Because of this, one of the core requirements should be that the application is lightweight with low performance impact. 

If possible, I’d also like to implement some kind of GUI for interacting with timers that have already been set such as a window where each timer is displayed as a box with their settings inside, also allowing you to delete any timer by clicking a close button that is inside the box. 

While there are already many timer applications that are available on both the web and as mobile apps, I think that I can make this application stand out by providing unique timer presets that can be scheduled for any day of the week in combination with other popular timers and alarms, all in one convenient package with minimal performance impact to the user’s pc. Because of the nature of the app, it is mainly useful to people who use their PCs for long periods of time, therefore I think the main users of this application will be anyone who studies, wants to create a structured routine with timers, or works from home.
