Prior to implementation Project Overview:

This application will allow you to add timers and alarms to specific days of the week. Preset timers will be included on the sidebar with their own customisation options, including alarm volume, 
alarm sound(including an option to import your own alarm sound),  alarm notifications from the browser window(on or off) both for start time and end time, day(s) of the week to set, start time, end time or duration, duration of the alarm, 
and name of the timer.
You will be able to save your currently active timers and configuration settings by saving to a database or exporting to a file(one or both).
There will be 3 windows you can swap between in this application(these will be accessed at the top of the page), one window will have the functionality for customising and adding timers this will include the preset tabs on the sidebar, another window will have
a graphical user interface which will display all currently active timers as boxes with their configuration settings inside the box(optional requirement to configure the customisation from this window), the last window will display the days of the week in a
calendar like format - with the currently active timers displayed at the time they are set in a list. 
These are the basic functionality of this single page application
